# Incognito Shell

Incognito Shell is a simple Bash script that spawns a new shell where command history is **not recorded**, making it ideal for situations where **privacy, stealth, and evasion** are required. 

##  Why Use This?
- Running commands on a **machine you don‚Äôt own** (e.g., jump boxes, bastion hosts).
- **Red team operations** where avoiding detection is crucial.
- Ensuring **commands do not persist** in history logs.
- Quickly **spawning a clean shell** without modifying existing history files.

##  Features
‚úîÔ∏è Works with **Bash**, **Zsh**, and **Sh**  
‚úîÔ∏è **No changes** to `.bash_history` or `.zsh_history`  
‚úîÔ∏è **Executes a clean shell** without profiles or history tracking
